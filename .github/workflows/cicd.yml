# Example GitHub Actions config for UW-IT AXD2 app testing and publishing to PyPi
#
# Preconditions:
#
#  1) Application test suite is kicked off by APP_NAME/test.py
#
#  2) Application contains a setup.py file
#
#  3) Application repo has access to the required secret
#     at https://github.com/organizations/uw-it-aca/settings/secrets:
#
#     PYPI_API_TOKEN
#
# To adapt this config to a specific Python app:
#
#  1) Set APP_NAME to the name of the package name/directory.
#
#  2) Verify that the lists of branches for push/pull_request is appropriate,
#     and add other branch names if needed.
